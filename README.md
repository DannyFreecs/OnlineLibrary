# OnlineLibrary
An online library for borrowing books.


This project is a 2 in 1. First there is an ASP.NET Core 2+ MVC-based application, which is the website of the library, where a user can register, sign in/out, searching for books, and renting them. The other one is a RESTful .NET Core WebAPI plus a desktop application for the librarians who can manage administrative issues through it, like adding new books/volumes, or change the rent statuses of an item.
